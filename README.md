# AttritionHR
The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts employee attrition using various employee
characteristics and work-related features. The task involves using supervised learning techniques, with a focus on classification, to predict
whether an employee will leave the company (Attrition: Yes/No) based on a set of factors like job satisfaction, age, education, work-life
balance, and other relevant attributes.

The dataset used for this task is the HR Analytics dataset, which contains 38 features and 1,480 rows of employee data. The dataset includes
 attributes such as Age, DistanceFromHome, MonthlyIncome, JobSatisfaction, and YearsAtCompany, which are highly correlated with
 employee retention and performance. The goal is to create a machine learning model that can accurately predict attrition, providing valuable
 insights for human resources management.
